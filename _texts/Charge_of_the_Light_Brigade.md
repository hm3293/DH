## I
- Half a league, half a league,
- Half a league onward,
- All in the valley of Death
- {:.indent-1}Rode the six hundred
- "Forward, the Light Brigade!
- Charge for the guns!" he said.
- Into the valley of Death[^fn1]
- {:.indent-1} Rode the six hundred
## II
- "Forward the Light Brigade!"
- Was there a man dismayed?
- Not though the soilde knew
- {:.indent-1} Someone had blundered.
- {:.indent-1} Theirs not to make reply
- {:.indent-1} Theirs not to reason why,
- {:.indent-1} Theirs but to do and die.
- {:.indent-1} Into the valley of Death
- {:.indent-1} Rode the six hundred.
## III
- Cannon to right of them,
- Cannon to left of them,
- Cannon in front of them
- {:.indent-1} Volleyed and thundered;
- Stormed at with shot and shell,
- Boldly they rode and well,
- Into the jaws of Death,
- Into the mouth of hell
- {:.indent-1} Rode the six hundred.
## IV
- Flashed all their sabres bare,
- Flashed as they turned in air
- Flashed all their sabres bare,
- Flashed as they turned in air
- Sabring the gunners there,
- Charging an army, while
- {:.indent-1}   All the world wondered.
- Plunged in the battery-smoke
- Right through the line they broke;
- Cossack and Russian
- Reeled from the sabre stroke
- {:.indent-1}   Shattered and sundered.
- Then they rode back, but not
- {:.indent-1} Not the six hundred. 
## V
- Cannon to right of them,
- Cannon to left of them,
- Cannon behind them
- {:.indent-1}   Volleyed and thundered;
- Stormed at with shot and shell,
- While horse and hero fell.
- They that had fought so well
- Came through the jaws of Death,
- Back from the mouth of hell,
- All that was left of them,
- {:.indent-1} Left of six hundred.
## VI
- When can their glory fade?
- O the wild charge they made!
- {:.indent-1} All the world wondered.
- Honour the charge they made!
- Honour the Light Brigade,
- {:.indent-1} Noble six hundred!
